I've recently started my journey to become a Python developer, and I'm learning and growing every day with the help of DevsTree IT.

This repo is part of my learning path â€” a place where Iâ€™ll be trying out new things, building small projects, and getting hands-on with Python. I'm aiming to not just learn, but to actually understand how things work and apply them in real-world scenarios.

ðŸš€ What I'm focusing on:

Strengthening my core Python skills
Working on practical exercises and mini-projects
Building a solid foundation in development

Feel free to check out my progress, and any feedback is always welcome!
