#Test-Driven Development (TDD):- Test-Driven Development is a software development practice 

# where you:
# Write tests first before writing any actual code.
# Run the tests and watch them fail (since there's no implementation yet).
# Write the minimum code needed to make the tests pass.
# Refactor the code (clean it up) while ensuring tests still pass.
# Repeat!

# In short: Red â†’ Green â†’ Refactor

# ðŸ§  Why TDD?
# Ensures code does what it's supposed to do
# Helps you think through requirements clearly
# Makes your code easier to maintain and refactor
