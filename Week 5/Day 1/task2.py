# CRUD Operations :- Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for database records

import sqlite3

# Connect to database (creates file if it doesnâ€™t exist)
conn = sqlite3.connect("inventory.db")

# Create a cursor (used to run SQL commands)

# CRUD operations

# (C)CREATE --> Insert data 

# Insert multiple categories
